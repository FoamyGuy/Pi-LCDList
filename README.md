Pi-LCDList
==========

Created by Foamyguy

To use: Edit the entries in the actionList.
The first column are the names that appear
on the LCD screen. The second column are the
names of python files that you want to run
when the user selects that item in the list.

e.g.

    actionList = [("Have fun", "have_fun.py"),
                  ("Help People", "help_people.py"),
                  ("Teach People", "teach_people.py"),
                  ("Always Learn", "always_learn.py"),
                  ("Turn Off", "turn_off.py")]
